    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the tribute page dedicated to Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent figure in the Indian independence
      movement. Subhas Chandra Bose, fondly known as Netaji, was a revolutionary leader, a freedom fighter, and a
      visionary who dedicated his life to the cause of India's independence from British rule. This page aims to honor
      his contributions, sacrifices, and enduring legacy.</p>

    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. He
      hailed from a prominent Bengali family and received his early education in Cuttack and later in Calcutta (now
      Kolkata). Bose was an exceptional student with a keen interest in nationalist politics from a young age.</p>

    <h2>Political Career and Activism</h2>
    <p>Bose's political journey began during his student days when he joined the Indian National Congress (INC) and was
      influenced by prominent leaders like Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das. His commitment to the cause of independence led
      him to organize protests, strikes, and mass movements against British colonial rule.</p>
    <p>During his tenure as the INC president in 1938 and 1939, Bose advocated for complete independence from British
      rule, which brought him into conflict with the party leadership. Eventually, he resigned from the INC and formed
      the Forward Bloc, advocating for more radical means to achieve independence.</p>

    <h2>The Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army)</h2>
    <p>One of Bose's most significant contributions to India's freedom struggle was the establishment of the Azad Hind
      Fauj (Indian National Army or INA) during World War II. He sought the support of Axis powers, particularly Nazi
      Germany and Imperial Japan, to mobilize Indian prisoners of war and civilians from Southeast Asia for the
      liberation of India.</p>
    <p>Under Bose's leadership, the INA played a crucial role in galvanizing Indian sentiment against British rule. His
      famous rallying cry, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," inspired thousands to join the struggle for
      independence.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's legacy is that of a fearless leader who dared to challenge the might of the British Empire
      and inspire millions with his vision of a free India. Despite his mysterious disappearance in 1945, Bose remains
      an enduring symbol of courage, determination, and sacrifice.</p>
    <p>His contributions to India's independence movement continue to inspire generations of Indians to strive for
      justice, equality, and freedom. From streets and institutions named after him to statues and memorials erected in
      his honor, Bose's presence looms large in the collective memory of the nation.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's unwavering commitment to the cause of India's independence and his relentless pursuit of
      freedom for his countrymen make him a towering figure in Indian history. As we pay tribute to his memory, let us
      remember his words: "Freedom is not given, it is taken." May his indomitable spirit continue to guide us in our
      quest for a better, more just society.</p>
    <p><em>Jai Hind!</em></p>
